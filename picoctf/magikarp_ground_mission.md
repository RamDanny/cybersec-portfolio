Challenge Link: [Magikarp Ground Mission](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/189)

Connect to the challenge instance. The first part of the flag is present in the starting directory.
The instructions provided ask to traverse to other directories to reveal subsequent parts of the flag.
This can be done easily using the `ssh`, `ls`, and `cat` commands alone.
Using all three parts of the flag, the final flag is formed.
